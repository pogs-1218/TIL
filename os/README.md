# Operating System Again.
This project is to know about the Operating System with system programming.<br>
I am not an expert even though I have learend and used thos things now and before..<br>
That's a problem.<br>
Let's focus on system programming again.<br>

# Overview
1. Reading two books about OS
2. Linux book(How Linux Works)

## Have to proficient
Debugging with GDB<br>
IPC Mechanism(pipes, message queues, shared memory)<br>
Multi-Thread<br>
Network<br>
Realtime System<br>

Networking

Graphics

Security

# System Programming Projects
1. File Encryption Utility
2. Network Packet Sniffer
3. Multithreaded Web Server
4. Linux Device Driver
5. Memory Allocator

# Concepts to understand
Process Management

Memory Management

File Systems

IPC(Inter Process Communication)

# Temp Note
OS make CPU and memory be virtualized.
I hvae only one CPU processor with a few cores.
The working of CPU is simple.

1. Fetch an instruction from memory.
2. Decode the instruction to CPU commands.
3. Execute CPU commands
4. Store the result in the memory.

Memory perspective.
The capacity of the physical memory is fixed.
Memory has address.
Each process running on OS has its own virtual address space.
OS controls this memory management mechanism.

Memory as a persistance view.
Moery system memory is DRAM which is volatile.
Which means that the data is out when the system is off.
If that?
Persistent disks are needed like HDD, SSD.
The data in disks are files.

Virtualizing CPU<br>
The key concept is time sharing mechanism from OS.<br>
