- synchronous/asynchronous and synchronized/nonsynchronized
: need to understand how input/ouput is worked in the linux kernel.
: understand user level buffer, kernel buffer, disk.

- io scheduler.
: disk address
: disk component(physical, logical)
: 

- io scheduling algorithms

TODO:
- Use <aio.h>
- Compare between synchronous and asynchronous in the test project.
- Understand disk cache, page, page fault. and file in both Windows and Linux.

By now, I have been covered I/O in Linux. Learn how to use basic linux system call,
read, write, open and so on. Learn beffering in user level and advanced linux system call for performance.
Let's do the final project in order to understand I/O in linux system.
